<h1 align="center">Hangfire Speakeasy Website</h1>

[View the live project here.](https://tomaserudito.github.io/other_speakeasy/)

<p>This is the website created for a restaurant called Hangfire. They are hosting a new series of events under the name “Hangfire Speakeasy”. These events are special events where they create special food and drinks menus for each event.</p>
<br/>
<h2 align="center"><img src="assets/images/readme_images/devices.jpg"></h2><br/>

## Design<br/>
<br/>
<p>The spaces are limited, and they must be reserved, this gives the event some exclusivity value. The idea around the name, exclusivity, and the type of food / drinks they will create define the colour scheme used for the website: The roaring 20’s.</p> 
<br/>
<h2 align="center"><img src="assets/images/readme_images/colour_palette.png"></h2>
<br/>
<p>The approach for the layout was focused on the power of the imagery. The visitor should feel the ambient and the “essence” of the events without need to read long texts. The images are telling the story. Based on this principle, we searched for powerful images that represent the concept clearly: nice food, exciting drinks, cool and relaxed people… all involved in a golden and dark ambient.</p>

<p>The information’s organization should be simple answering 3 questions:</p>

<p class="indent">•	Who are we?</p>
<p class="indent">•	What do we offer?</p>
<p class="indent">•	How can you get what we offer?</p>

<p>So, the website is divided in 3 pages:</p>

<p class="indent">•	Index – Presentation of the new events.</p>
<p class="indent">•	Menu – Presentation of the food and drinks.</p>
<p class="indent">•	Next Events – How to book / when.</p>

<p>The potential customers would be people between 25 and 45 years old, with a medium / high income. These group of people usually are professionals and they main device to connect socially is the mobile phone / tablet, for this reason the design of the website has been created focused on the mobile first approach.</p>

<p>This was the proposed design for the different pages.</p>

<br/>
<div style="width:100%;">
<img src="assets/images/readme_images/home_mobile.png" width="32%">
<img src="assets/images/readme_images/menu_mobile.png" width="32%">
<img src="assets/images/readme_images/events_mobile.png" width="32%">
</div>
<br/>
<br/>

<p>The structure is simple so the users can navigate easily through the content, get the information fast, and they should be able of complete the purchase at any moment: </p>

<p class="indent">•	Header with navigation menu.</p>
<p class="indent">•	Main suggestive image.</p>
<p class="indent">•	Banner with booking access.</p>
<p class="indent">•	Content with big imagery.</p>
<p class="indent">•	Extra information (menu / location…).</p>
<p class="indent">•	Footer with social media links</p>

<p>The typographies used are Asanine (used for the Hangfire logo), Montecarlo (used for the Speakeasy logo), and Barlow, a very easy to read typography that matches the retro and elegant style of the design (used for all the text on the website).</p>
<br/>

<br/>

<p>The languages used are:</p>

<p class="indent">•	HTML 5</p>
<p class="indent">•	CSS</p>

<p>Also, during the creation of the different elements of the project, I used:</p>

<p class="indent">•	GitHub – Used to store the project.</p>
<br/>

## Testing<br/>
<br/>
	
<p>The W3C validator has been used to ensure that every HTML and CSS files are free of syntax errors*.</p>

<p class="indent">*(I decided to ignore the warning about using sections without a header as this helps in the HTML structure to be clearer and some sections’ contents are mainly graphic and don’t need any header or introduction).</p>

<p>The website has been tested on different browsers:</p>

<p class="indent">•	Google Chrome</p>
<p class="indent">•	Microsoft Edge</p>
<p class="indent">•	Opera</p>
<p class="indent">•	Firefox</p>

<p>Also has been tested on different devices:</p>

<p class="indent">•	Laptop (Windows)</p>
<p class="indent">•	Desktop (Windows)</p>
<p class="indent">•	Android tablets</p>
<p class="indent">•	Mobile phones (Android)</p>
<br/>
<p>More testing has been done about usability and user experience. To achieve this, I proposed to some friends to navigate through the website and answer the questions about the UX goals explained before:</p>
